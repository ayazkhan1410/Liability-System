- Always format code with Black/PEP8.
- Use Python type hints on all public functions and methods.
- Prefer DRFâ€™s ModelViewSet + DefaultRouter over manual URL patterns.
- Declare and use DRF Serializers for all input/output validation.
- Write or update unit tests (pytest/django) for every view, serializer, and model.
- Favor descriptive names (e.g. `customer_orders` vs `co`).
- Keep methods under 50 lines; extract reusable logic into services/helpers.
- Guard against common OWASP issues (e.g. validate inputs, avoid eval()).
- Return consistent JSON: always wrap lists and objects in named keys.
- Include simple docstrings on classes and non-trivial methods only.
